            <h1>Wave Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Wave does not ask for or collect personal information. This includes name, email, age, sex, phone number, location, or any identifying information of any kind.</p>
            <p>Saved sessions include raw EEG data as read from the Muse headset along with metadata.</p>
            <p>Sessions are stored locally on the device Wave is installed on; they are not uploaded to or hosted on a remote server.</p>
            <p>Sessions can be deleted at any time within the app, which removes all the session data permanently. If Wave is deleted from the user's device, all session data is permanently removed as well.</p>
            <p>Wave does not share or give access to sessions, including raw EEG data collected as part of the regular functionality of the app, with any third-party, including Interaxon (the makers of the Muse headband accessory).</p>
            <p>Wave does not use any third-party service for analytics gathering or tracking within the app.</p>
